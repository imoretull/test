Test Bug Tracking Management (open source)
- Front end only test case tracker to be used for applications with 1-3 QA
- No installation, server required!  HTML file only.


Issues:
FEATURES: 
- push to open source gh
- use default to Age = Established
- Copy sub header and copy test cases header for user friendly clipboard (medium)
- Export bundled html (low)
- AI integration with Claude API?  (risky, at h only)

BUGS:
- fix CSS (2 issues) (low)
- Notes should be replaced by whatever is in tqt file (check this)

DONE
- shortcut keys - redo (FEATURE)
- new category test case entries not sorted in csv file (causing id to be off)... adding toward bottom; table ids wrong (BUG)
- reduce Notes text (BUG)
- Resources tab for Figma, flows, etc.. with links showing (saves in tqt file) (FEATURE)
- Cannot see the Scope for quick changes in table, maybe some visual indicator
- AllCategories shown in Search filter (BUG)
- Add Test Case = add tag dropdown for symbol to be added (FEAGTURE)
